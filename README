 M2Crypto 0.06 (20 Jul 2001)
-----------------------------

M2Crypto = Python + OpenSSL + SWIG.

M2 stands for "me, too!"*

M2Crypto makes accessible to the Python programmer the following:

    - DH, RSA, DSA, symmetric ciphers, message digests, HMACs.
    - SSL functionality to implement clients and servers.
    - S/MIME v2.

M2Crypto is released under a very liberal BSD-style licence. See 
LICENCE for details.


This release supports Python 1.5.2, Python 2.0 and Python 2.1. It requires 
at least OpenSSL 0.9.6, and has been tested with OpenSSL 0.9.6a. It needs 
SWIG 1.3.6.


Note these caveats:

1. Possible memory leaks, because some objects need to be freed on the 
Python side and other objects on the C side, and these may change between 
OpenSSL versions. (Multiple free's lead to crashes very quickly, so 
these should have been rooted out.)

2. No memory locking/clearing for keys, passphrases, etc.

3. PRNG may not be CS**; it may not be CS***.

4. AFAIK, Python and OpenSSL have not been subjected to the full attention 
of the Bugtraq crowd. M2Crypto's handling of active hostile input is 
probably suspect.

Of course, I hope to address these in future.

Meanwhile, have fun! Your feedback is welcome.

* Similar software are Marc-Andre Lemburg's mxCrypto, and two earlier
Python interfaces to the SSL portion of SSLeay/OpenSSL. Since M2Crypto 
came into being, yet more Python OpenSSL wrappers have appeared.

** Continuous seeding.

*** Cryptographically strong.
