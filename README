 M2Crypto 0.05 (27 Nov 2000)
-----------------------------

M2Crypto = Python + OpenSSL + SWIG.

M2 stands for "me, too!"*

M2Crypto makes accessible to the Python programmer the following:

    - DH, RSA, DSA, symmetric ciphers, message digests, HMACs.
    - SSL functionality to implement clients and servers.
    - S/MIME v2.

M2Crypto is released under a very liberal BSD-style license. See 
LICENCE for details.


This release supports both Python 1.5.2 and Python 2.0. It has been 
tested with OpenSSL 0.9.6. It requires a post-1.1p5 build of SWIG.
(I use build-786.) Current alpha versions of SWIG 1.3 may or may not
work.


For now, M2Crypto works fine as a prototyping tool. Note the following 
caveats:

1. Possible memory leaks, because of pointer ownership contention
between Python and SWIG. (These would be due to my misprogramming.)

2. No memory locking/clearing for keys, passphrases, etc.

3. PRNG is not CS**; it is unlikely to be CS***.

4. AFAIK, Python and OpenSSL have not been subjected to the full attention 
of the Bugtraq crowd. M2Crypto's handling of active hostile input is 
probably suspect.

Of course, I hope to address these in future.

Meanwhile, have fun! Your feedback is welcome.

Python interfaces to the SSL portion of SSLeay/OpenSSL.
