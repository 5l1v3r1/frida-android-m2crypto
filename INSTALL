You need Python 2.1, 2.2, OpenSSL 0.9.6 or later, and SWIG 1.3.17.  Earlier
versions of Python may or may not work. This distribution is tested with
OpenSSL 0.9.6h.


Standard installation procedure
-------------------------------
This works on Unix and Windows/MSVC++. 

$ unzip m2crypto-0.08.zip
$ cd m2crypto-0.08
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py test
$ python setup.py install


Building on Windows with mingw32
---------------------------------
My platform is Bloodshed Dev-C++ version 4; Mingw compiler 2.95.2-1.

First, build OpenSSL 0.9.6h using mingw32. This produces openssl.exe, libssl32.a
and libeay32.a. To keep setup.py simple, rename libssl32.a and libeay32.a to
libssleay32.a and liblibeay32.a, respectively. Install the .a files somewhere; I
use c:/pkg/openssl/lib. (.h files go into c:/pkg/openssl/include.) Now follow
the standard installation procedure above.


Building on Windows with BC++ free compiler suite
--------------------------------------------------
This is currently broken, probably due to interaction between this version of
SWIG and BC++. Since I have mingw32 working, I'm unlikely to attempt to fix
this.


Building on Mac OS X
---------------------
Richard Jones <richard@bizarsoftware.com.au> has kindly contributed a
makefile for Mac OS X. It is included here as Makefile.osx. I have not
tested it myself.

1. cd swig
2. Fix paths in Makefile.osx.
3. Python 2.1: make -f Makefile.osx
   Python 2.0: dunno, give it a go...
   Python 1.5.2: dunno, give it a go...
4. cd ..
5. Install the directory M2Crypto into a directory on the PYTHONPATH.
6. If you have PyUnit installed: 
   cd tests, python alltests.py
7. cd ..
8. cd demo
9. Try out the various test programs.

Here are Richard's instructions on building OpenSSL 0.9.6 on OS X:

> That and one needs to install openssl-0.9.6. But that's a whole other
> story. In short:
> 1. ./Configure OpenBSD
> 2. edit root Makefile to change "gcc" to "cc"
> 3. edit Makefile in apps and test to change the libraries to:
>   LIBCRYPTO=../libcrypto.a
>   LIBSSL=../libssl.a
> 
> and you're there.
