You need Python 1.5.2, 2.0 or 2.1, OpenSSL 0.9.6 and a post-1.1p5 build of
SWIG. (I use build-786.) Alpha versions of SWIG 1.3 may or may not work;
they are not supported.

Apparently SWIG 1.1-786 is now hard to find on the net. I've put up a
source tarball here:

    http://www.post1.com/home/ngps/swig-1.1-786.tgz


A Distutils setup.py is being worked on; it is held up by limitations 
in Distutils 1.0 wherein the SWIG call interface cannot be customised 
by the module developer.

I expect to have a working Distutils setup.py eventually. In the meantime,
please use the makefiles.

I have received mail regarding the hassle of having to fix the paths to
OpenSSL libraries in the Makefiles. Several people opined that I should fix
the paths to the 'standard', which for OpenSSL 0.9.6 is /usr/local/ssl on
Un*x.

My personal preference (and the default for OpenSSL 0.9.5) is /usr/local.
Please bear with me and continue to do the fixing. Note that Python 2.1
uses 'Makefile', Python 2.0 'Makefile.py20' and Python 1.5.2
'Makefile.py1'.

Building on Win32 requires MS VC++ 6.0 or the freely-available Borland C++
command line tools. It should be fairly obvious which makefile to use for
your compiler suite.

Richard XXX has kindly contributed a Mac OS X makefile. I have not tested
this myself.


Building on Unix
-----------------
1. cd swig
2. Fix paths in Makefile (Makefile.py20, Makefile.py1) if necessary.
3. Python 2.1: make
   Python 2.0: make -f Makefile.py20
   Python 1.5.2: make -f Makefile.py1
4. cd ..
5. Install the directory M2Crypto into a directory on the PYTHONPATH.
6. If you have PyUnit installed: 
   cd tests, python alltests.py
7. cd ..
8. cd demo
9. Try out the various test programs.


Building on Windows
--------------------
1. cd swig
2. Fix paths in Makefile.vc (Makefile.vc.py20, Makefile.vc.py1, etc.) if 
   necessary.
3. Python 2.1: "nmake -f Makefile.vc" or "make -f Makefile.bc"
   Python 2.0: "nmake -f Makefile.vc.py20" or "make -f Makefile.bc.py20"
   Python 1.5.2: "nmake -f Makefile.vc.py1" or "make -f Makefile.bc.py1"
4. cd ..
5. Install the directory M2Crypto into a directory on the PYTHONPATH.
6. If you have PyUnit installed: 
   cd tests, python alltests.py
7. cd ..
8. cd demo
9. Try out the various test programs.


Building on Mac OS X
---------------------
1. cd swig
2. Fix paths in Makefile.osx if necessary.
3. Python 2.1: make -f Makefile.osx
   Python 2.0: dunno
   Python 1.5.2: dunno
4. cd ..
5. Install the directory M2Crypto into a directory on the PYTHONPATH.
6. If you have PyUnit installed: 
   cd tests, python alltests.py
7. cd ..
8. cd demo
9. Try out the various test programs.
