This directory contains Win32 binaries for M2Crypto.

Each of the directories py1/, py20/ and py21/ contains the following:
- _m2cryptoc.dll
- _m2crypto.py

Copy the two files into ../M2Crypto. 

If you use Python 2.1, copy the files in py21; if Python 2.0, py20; if 
Python 1.5.2, py1.


The following OpenSSL DLLs are also required on your PATH:
- libeay32.dll
- ssleay32.dll

A binary package of the two OpenSSL DLLs are available
via separate download from http://www.post1.com/home/ngps/m2.
