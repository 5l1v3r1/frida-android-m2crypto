- Reported memory leak due to cyclical definitions of
_write_bio/_write_nbio and _read_bio/_read_nbio in SSL.Connection.

- evp_ciph_demo.py, which uses the EVP.Cipher API, dumps core when
the AES ciphers are tested. bio_ciph_test.py, which uses BIO.CipherStream,
do not.

- SSL.Connection.makefile() returns an instance of BIO.IOBuffer, 
which is a file-like object. If you close the SSL.Connection, then 
try to read()/write() the BIO.IOBuffer, you'll get unpredictable 
results.

- If you pass in bogus callbacks, the interpreter might crash. This 
has been fixed for RSA, DSA, DH callbacks, but not for SSL callbacks, 
yet.

- Python 2.[23]: FTP/TLS passive mode client doesn't work against the 
Medusa-based ftps_server. (Works using Python 2.1.)

- Possible concurrency bugs in the SSL functionality as reported by Brent
Chun.

- demo/ssl/echod-forking.py no longer works. (Tested with Python 2.2.2.)
I won't bother try fixing this, since forking servers are passe.
